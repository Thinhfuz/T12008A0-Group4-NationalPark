                <br>
                <p>Ross Castle, built on the shores of Lough Leane, is a fine example of a 15th Century stone tower
                    house.
                    It was home to the Chieftan O’Donoghue Mór and the castle was one of the last Gaelic strongholds in
                    Ireland. Control and ownership of the castle was contested throughout the 17th and early 18th
                    Centuries
                    by the Gaelic Irish, Cromwellian forces, Jacobite and Williamite supporters. A garrison of troops
                    were
                    billeted at the barracks attached to the castle during the 17th and 18th Centuries. Ross Castle was
                    ultimately the property of the Browne’s until 1956 and this historic structure was generously
                    donated to
                    the Republic of Ireland by John and Mary McShain in 1970. It has been open to the public since it’s
                    restoration in 1990. The castle contains historic period oak furniture from the 16th and 17th
                    Centuries.
                    The castle is located at the edge of Lough Leane and can be accessed by walking and cycling routes
                    within the National Park. Ross Castle is a National Monument and is maintained by the Office of

            <p>As previously alluded to, the lands of the Browne Family at Ross and Molahiffe dated back to the late
                16th century. Despite being Roman Catholic the Browne’s married into leading Gaelic families and
                received titles of Viscount Kenmare and Baron Castlerosse in 1689 and became Earls of Kenmare in 1802.
                By the early 17th Century they had large estates in Cork, Kerry and Limerick but by end of the century
                their lands were confiscated by the Crown following the Treaty of Limerick.

                In 1720, Sir Valentine Browne regained the family estates with the exception of Ross Castle, and he
                subsequently remodelled an earlier 17th century house close to the town of Killarney, known as ‘Kenmare
                House’. This house was extended in the late 18th and mid 19th century before being demolished in the
                1880s when a new Victorian mansion was built at Knockreer, pictured above right. The Browne family also
                fulfilled a major social and political role and was very involved in the development of Killarney town
                as well as developing the demesne landscape of the Kenmare Estate. However, at the end of 19th century,
                due to financial problems and the effects of the Land Acts, the Browne family’s land holdings were
                reduced. Nevertheless, they still retained ownership of a considerable portion of the mountain land
                surrounding the Killarney Lakes as well as demesne lands of approximately 600 ha (1500 acres).</p>
