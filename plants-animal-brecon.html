                <h3 class="sub-title--small">Ducks, geese and swans</h3>
                <p>The swans, ducks and geese are medium to large birds that are adapted to an aquatic existence with
                    webbed feet and bills which are flattened to a greater or lesser extent. In many ducks the male is
                    colourful while the female is dull brown. The diet consists of a variety of animals and plants. The
                    family is well represented in Wales, especially in winter when large numbers visit from Greenland,
                    Scandinavia and Russia. There are about 160 species worldwide, 53 in Britain and 47 in Wales.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h3 class="sub-title--small">Grouse</h3>
                <p>Grouse are sturdy, medium-sized terrestrial birds of the Northern Hemisphere. They have feathered
                    feet and nostrils and short, rounded wings. They feed mainly on plant material and lay their eggs in
                    a simple scrape on the ground. They are gamebirds and large numbers were shot in the past in
                    moorland areas.[15] There are about 19 species worldwide, 4 in Britain and 2 in Wales.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h3 class="sub-title--small">Pheasants and partridges</h3>
                <p>These are terrestrial species, feeding and nesting on the ground. They are variable in size but
                    generally plump, with broad and relatively short wings. There are about 155 species worldwide, with
                    6 in Britain and Wales. 4 of these were introduced for hunting or ornamental purposes but 2 have now
                    apparently died out.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <h3 class="sub-title--small">Divers</h3>
                <p>Divers are aquatic birds the size of a large duck, to which they are unrelated. They swim well and
                    fly adequately but are almost hopeless on land, because their legs are placed towards the rear of
                    the body. They feed on fish and other aquatic animals. There are 5 species worldwide, with 4 in
                    Britain and Wales. They are all non-breeding visitors in Wales.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h3 class="sub-title--small">Grebes</h3>
                <p>Grebes are small to medium-large diving birds with lobed toes and pointed bills. They are seen mainly
                    on lowland waterbodies and coasts. They feed on aquatic animals and nest on a floating platform of
                    vegetation. There are about 19 species worldwide, with 6 in Britain and Wales.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h3 class="sub-title--small">Albatrosses</h3>
                <p>The albatrosses are among the largest flying birds with long, narrow wings for gliding. The majority
                    are found in the Southern Hemisphere with only vagrants occurring in the North Atlantic. There are
                    at least 13 species worldwide, with 1 in Britain and Wales.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h3 class="sub-title--small">Petrels and shearwaters</h3>
                <p>These are highly pelagic birds with long, narrow wings and tube-shaped nostrils. They feed at sea on
                    fish, squid and other marine life. They come to land to breed in colonies, nesting in burrows or on
                    cliffs. There are 9 species which have been recorded in Wales.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h3 class="sub-title--small">Herons and bitterns</h3>
                <p>Herons and egrets are medium to large wading birds with long necks and legs. Bitterns tend to be
                    shorter-necked and more secretive. They all fly with their necks retracted. The sharp bill is used
                    to catch fish, amphibians and other animals. Many species nest in colonies, often in trees.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h3 class="sub-title--small">Hawks and eagles</h3>
                <p>A family of birds of prey which includes hawks, buzzards, eagles, kites and harriers. These birds
                    have very large powerful hooked beaks for tearing flesh from their prey, strong legs, powerful
                    talons and keen eyesight. There are about 240 species worldwide, 16 in Britain and 12 in Wales.</p>

                <h3 class="sub-title--small">Mammals</h3>
                <p>Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and fallow deer (Dama dama) are the two largest mammal species in
                    Wales. Roe deer are found in central and northern Wales. Fallow deer are found in rural and
                    semiurban areas of Wales. The European polecat (Mustela putorius) can be found in both urban and
                    country environments. Found in the same area is the red fox, one of the most common mammals in
                    Wales.
                    <br><br>
                    The red deer, one of five native deer species, is the biggest non-marine mammal in Wales. Fallow,
                    muntjac roe and sika deer can also be found. pine martens are very rarely seen. Other mammals
                    include badgers, foxes, hares, hedgehogs, otters, rabbits, stoats, weasels, red squirrels, and 13
                    species of bat.</p>

                <h3 class="sub-title--small">Red squirrel</h3>
                <p>The red squirrel or Eurasian red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) is a species of tree squirrel in the
                    genus Sciurus common throughout Eurasia. The red squirrel is an arboreal, primarily herbivorous
                    rodent.
                    <br><br>
                    In Great Britain, Ireland, and in Italy numbers have decreased drastically in recent years.[citation
                    needed] This decline is associated with the introduction by humans of the eastern grey squirrel
                    (Sciurus carolinensis) from North America. However, the population in Scotland is stabilising[3] due
                    to conservation efforts, awareness and the increasing population of the pine marten, a European
                    predator that selectively controls grey squirrels.</p>
                <h3 class="sub-title--small">Lesser horseshoe bat</h3>
                <p>The lesser horseshoe bat is one of the world's smallest bats, weighing only 5 to 9 grams, with a
                    wingspan of 192–254 mm and a body length of 35–45 mm. It has strong feet that it uses to grasp rocks
                    and branches, and can see well in spite of its small eyes. Like most bats, lesser horseshoe bats
                    live in colonies and hunt their prey by echolocation, emitting ultrasound from specialized round
                    pads in their mouth.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title--small">Narcissus pseudonarcissus</h3>
        <p>This species has pale yellow flowers, with a darker central trumpet. The long, narrow leaves are slightly
            greyish green in colour and rise from the base of the stem. The plant grows from a bulb. The flowers produce
            seeds, which when germinated, take five to seven years to produce a flowering plant. (Sexual [seed]
            reproduction mixes the traits of both parent flowers, so if garden hybrid cultivars are planted close to
            wild populations of Narcissus pseudonarcissus, there is a danger that the new seedlings, having hybrid
            vigour, could out-compete the wild plants.)</p>
        <h3 class="sub-title--small">Allium ampeloprasum</h3>
        <p>Allium ampeloprasum is a member of the onion genus Allium. The wild plant is commonly known as wild leek or
            broadleaf wild leek. Its native range is southern Europe to western Asia, but it is cultivated in many other
            places and has become naturalized in many countries.
            <br><br>
            Allium ampeloprasum is regarded as native to all the countries bordering on the Black, Adriatic, and
            Mediterranean Seas from Portugal to Egypt to Romania. In Russia and Ukraine, it is considered invasive
            except in Crimea, where it is native. It is also native to Ethiopia, Uzbekistan, Iran and Iraq. It is
            considered naturalized in the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Czech Republic, the Baltic States, Belarus, the
            Azores, Madeira, the Canary Islands, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Pakistan, China, Australia (all states except
            Queensland and Tasmania), Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Haiti, the United States
            (southeastern region plus California, New York State, Ohio and Illinois), Galápagos, and
            Argentina.[2][3][4][5][6] In tidewater Virginia, where it is commonly known as the "Yorktown onion", it is
            protected by law in York County.</p>

                <h3 class="sub-title--small">Higher Plants</h3>
                <p>A number of plant species found within the National Park have discontinuous geographic distributions
                    and are of localised occurrence within Ireland. The reasons for these wide gaps in the ranges of
                    these species have not been fully explained and it is now suggested that some may have been
                    introduced to this country.

                    St Patricks Cabbage
                    St Patrick’s Cabbage (Saxifraga spathularis)

                    Two saxifrages, St. Patrick’s cabbage (Saxifraga spathularis) and kidney saxifrage (Saxifraga
                    hirsuta), both frequent in the National Park, are found in western Ireland and northern Spain and
                    Portugal, but not in Britain or France. Greater butterwort (Pinguicula grandiflora), also frequent
                    in the National Park, occurs in the Pyrenees, Jura and western Alps.



                    Arbutus, which can be frequent in woodland margins in Killarney, is in other parts other parts of
                    Ireland and occurs elsewhere only in Western France and in its main range in the Mediterranean
                    region. Blue-eyed grass (Sisyrinchium bermudiana), found in the west and centre of Ireland and
                    occasionally in Kerry, is otherwise known only from North America.

                    Arbutus in flower

                    Some plants occurring on the uplands of the National Park have their main distributions in northern
                    and mountainous regions of Europe. Of these, mountain sorrel (Oxyria digyna) is an example of a true
                    Arctic-Alpine species, while others such as green spleenwort (Asplenium viride), Alpine clubmoss
                    (Diphasiastrum alpinum) and Irish saxifrage (Saxifraga rosacea) are somewhat more widely
                    distributed.</p>
